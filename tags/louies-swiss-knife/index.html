He didn’t know it yet, but over time, that tool would also help him fix code.</p>
<p>Over the years, he developed a passion for everything computer-related. He started by repeatedly breaking his own machines and learning to repair them. For that, he used his knife.</p>
<p>In private, he liked to brag about it to his family. He often complained that his dad had too many tools, while he managed everything with just his multi-tool.</p>
<p>Eventually, Louie graduated from university as a Software Engineer. His passion for computers had naturally led him to programming—he felt it was one of his callings. He no longer repaired machines as much; now he built systems for a software company.</p>
<p>In his first year, during an internship, he developed a feature for entering investment data into a financial system. A more experienced colleague was reviewing the code to add some accounting logic. Louie was proud of his work; it was a relatively complex feature for someone at his level—his boss had even praised him for his commitment to the project. But that day, in front of all the other engineers, he had one of his first professional disappointments.</p>
<p>His colleague started complaining about the code: in a single function, Louie had mixed amount validations, text conversions, UI manipulations, and hundreds of lines more per function.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Louie, man, you really need to refactor this. Try splitting things up into smaller functions or methods and give each one a single responsibility. It’s a nightmare to work with like this.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Louie felt a bead of sweat slide down his back. His hands went cold and clammy, while heat rushed from his chest to his head. He just wanted that moment to be over. His pride quickly morphed into despair, and shame washed over him as he noticed the looks of pity from his colleagues.</p>
<p>That evening, Louie came home disappointed, exhausted from a long commute involving three buses and a few kilometers on foot. His mind kept replaying all the feedback he had received. He remembered leaving his computer case open the day before after cleaning it. He grabbed his usual multi-tool and started screwing it shut. While applying pressure, the small screwdriver folded and pinched his finger. A curse escaped him in a deep groan—he knew the pain was more emotional than physical.</p>
<p>At that moment, his father saw him and, with a smug tone, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“That’s why I told you to use the proper screwdriver. Those tools are for emergencies. Each one has a single responsibility.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This would be the perfect moment to say Louie had a movie-like epiphany. That he suddenly connected the Single Responsibility Principle his code lacked to his trusty multi-tool.</p>
<p>That epiphany might have looked something like learning to weigh trade-offs—deciding when to use one tool or another, and in terms of code, how to modularize. On the one hand, the Swiss knife is handy in emergencies: it’s portable, lightweight, and easy to carry—but awkward in tight spots, and if misused, you might end up hurting yourself, like Louie did.</p>
<p>On the other hand, using a dedicated tool like a proper screwdriver is more ergonomic, faster, and safer—but carrying a full toolbox everywhere isn’t practical either.</p>
<p>The same applied to his class: it had everything crammed into one place, many long functions, and mixed levels of responsibility, making it hard to maintain. It was fast to build and worked well for basic scenarios—but not sustainable.</p>
<p>Separating responsibilities—even into different classes—improves maintainability, code control, and even testability. Of course, that also means more files, more lines of code, and depending on the language, increased verbosity.</p>
<p>The next day, Louie made the changes. He reorganized his code by responsibility: separating business validations from interface logic. It was just a start, but it felt like putting on a new pair of sneakers—strange at first, but with a pleasant sense of comfort and control.</p>
<p>That day, his colleague gave him a pat on the back for the effort. Over time, Louie would come to understand that all the fuss had been about the Single Responsibility Principle—and he’d learn that identifying the right level of modularization is always a bit of an art.</p>
<p>And just as he started using his father’s tools for more specific tasks, he would gradually internalize the principle… always remembering his trusty Swiss knife.</p> </article>  </main> <footer>
