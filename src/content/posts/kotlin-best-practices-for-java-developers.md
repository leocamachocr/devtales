Some years ago, I wrote an article for Gorilla Logic aimed at helping Java developers transition smoothly into Kotlin by adopting its best practices.

The post explores familiar patterns, language features, and differences that Java developers should understand to make the most of Kotlin in production environments.

**You can read the full article here:**

I still consider many of these recommendations useful today â€” especially when teams are migrating or maintaining codebases in both languages.

Let me know what you think, or feel free to share your own Kotlin tips!
